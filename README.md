# PyAPI
PyAPI utilizes the "requests" module for a large chuck of its functions and classes. You can learn about it here.
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
While making PyAPI, http://httpbin.org/ was a enormous help for bug testing, so shoutout to Kenneth Reitz for making it.

PyAPI is open source, so feel free to make edits and branch it. PyAPI will get better because of you.
