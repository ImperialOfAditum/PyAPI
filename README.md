# PyAPI
PyAPI is a REST client out of Python, coded by Sammy Hajhamid (That's me!). It's free for public use but if you want to use if for business and stuff, please contact me and I'd be happy to sort something out with you. It currently is in beta 0.1 (b.1) and supports GET requests, POST requests, and POST requests with one key and value (paramaters). Keep in mind PyAPI is very buggy and in beta, so please report bugs to me! It is command-line based (GUI coming soon) and I'll try to update it as much as I can. Branches are very much welcomed, as you can help grow PyAPI.


## Getting Started

The first step is downloading the file. It shouldn't be too hard as a added .bat file helps people who don't know programming or simple command line tasks. It should be ready to launch from the get-go.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x or higher is required, but not much else.

### Usage

Start by double clicking the start.bat. It should launch Python on a Command Prompt and you should be good to go.

PyAPI is very non-programmer friendly, meaning all you need to is input the data!
