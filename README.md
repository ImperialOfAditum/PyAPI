# PyAPI
PyAPI utilizes the "requests" module for a large chuck of its functions and classes. You can learn about it here.

http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

While making PyAPI, http://httpbin.org/ was a enormous help for bug testing.

PyAPI is open source, so feel free to make edits and branch it. PyAPI will get better because of you.

A enormous shout out to Kenneth Reitz, who made httpbin and the requests module. Couldn't have done it without you.
